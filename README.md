[Smart Maintenance](https://medium.com/@pawito236/smart-maintenance-918be0e2d915) Model architecture : Conv1D + relu as Feature extraction, 3 Dense + elu as Classification layer. The idea is Output Dense each Node will Represent each Motor Fault with this solution model can predict unseen class (Not in Training class)
